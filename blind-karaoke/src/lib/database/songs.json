Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low. Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.",

You're dangerous, I'm loving it. Too high, can't come down. Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round. Do you feel me now? With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride. You're toxic, I'm slippin' under. With a taste of a poison paradise. I'm addicted to you. Don't you know that you're toxic?",

And your hand touches mine. When we're done making love and you look up. And give me those eyes. Cause all of the small things that you do Are what remind me why I fell for you. And when we're apart and I'm missing you. I close my eyes and all I see is you. And the small things you do",
